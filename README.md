# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Apply the foundational Python skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.


In this project, I’ll apply the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
